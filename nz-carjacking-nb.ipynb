    "# Welcome!\n",
    "This is a notebook detailing my analysis of some data about motor theft in New Zealand over 6 months.\n",
    "The records contain information about the vehicle, including its unique ID, type, make, manufacture year, color the location of the incident, the day it was added to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "I figured it was an appropriate phenomenon to study, considering the imminent announcement of GTA VI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is kindly provided by the wonderful people at [Maven Analytics](mavenanalytics.io), it can be acquired there for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals:\n",
    "### Are there seasonality trends to this phenomenon?\n",
    "- I wonder if any crook would take the holidays as a chance to catch an owner off guard.\n",
    "### Which vehicle types were stolen the most? \n",
    "- I expect standard cars to be the biggest victims, luxury cars tend to have more security features, and I don't think a common outlaw would want to accidentally steal a mob boss' car. Trailers are such are also prime candidates because you can just stick them to a tractor of any kind and run off with them, with the owner inside if you're feeling adventurous.\n",
    "### What day of the week are vehicles most often and least often stolen?\n",
    "- I'm quite curious about this one! If you stole a car, what day would you choose to do it?\n",
    "### Is the model year a factor? Does it affect a vehicle differently based on its type?\n",
    "- I expect prized cars from the 80s and earlier to be prime targets, highly valuable (particularly Japanese cars) without as much security as say, a 2023 Mercedes.\n",
    "### Which regions had the most carjackings?\n",
    "- I have no idea what the New Zealand provinces are, but a little filled map action will sort us well.\n",
    "### Have carjackings increased or decreased in these six months?\n",
    "- Analyzing the changes and trends of the phenomenon.\n",
    "### Which regions are above or below the average rate of thefts?\n",
    "- Using **transform()**, we'll be able to analyze whether a region is safer than others or not.\n",
