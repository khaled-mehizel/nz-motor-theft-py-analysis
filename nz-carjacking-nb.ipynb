    "This is a notebook detailing my analysis of some data about motor theft in New Zealand over 6 months.\n",

    "### Which makes were stolen the most? \n",
    "- I expect standard cars to be the biggest victims, luxury cars tend to have more security features, and I don't think a common outlaw would want to accidentally steal a mob boss' car. Trailers are such are also prime candidates because you can just stick them to a tractor of any kind and run off with them, with the owner inside if you're feeling adventurous.\n",
    "### What day of the week are vehicles most often and least often stolen?\n",
    "- I'm quite curious about this one! If you stole a car, what day would you choose to do it?\n",
    "### Is the model year a factor? Does it affect a vehicle differently based on its type?\n",
    "- I expect prized cars from the 80s and earlier to be prime targets, highly valuable (particularly Japanese cars) without as much security as say, a 2023 Mercedes.\n",
    "### Which regions had the most carjackings?\n",
    "- I have no idea what the New Zealand provinces are, but a little filled map action will sort us well.\n",
    "### Have carjackings increased or decreased in these six months?\n",
    "- Analyzing the changes and trends of the phenomenon.\n",
